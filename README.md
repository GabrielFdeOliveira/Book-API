# NYT Best seller books API

This is a frontend project that leverages the NYT Books API and is built using TypeScript and React within the Vite framework. Its core functionality enables users to either search for a specific book through the search bar or fetch the current list of best-selling books, and then add them to their personal favorites list. While the browser's memory is currently used to persist data between sessions, a proper backend may be added in the future.

As the API does not provide a "rating" for books, I have implemented a randomized way to display it and have plans to enable users to give their own rating for books in their personal list. Additionally, the API returns 0 for all prices, and I am working towards making it possible to edit this value as well.

This project has pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I have had to work hard to find solutions to persist data and creatively style the application. While there is room for improvement, this project has the potential to grow, and I have done my best given my current skills and abilities.
