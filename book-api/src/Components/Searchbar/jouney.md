I struggled with this component for several hours trying to achieve pixel-perfect alignment with the wireframe. The default styles kept conflicting with the media queries, making it difficult to center the magnifying glass icon and the search button. Additionally, the search button appeared smaller than intended.

The most frustrating issue was the input text placeholder, which refused to adjust properly on smaller screens. I tried targeting the input directly and using webkit in the browser, but was unable to resolve the issue.

The search functionality was relatively straightforward for me, as I had prior experience implementing it in other projects. However, this was my first time using Typescript to build this feature.
